Create an image scanner AI with advanced selection of text & search on the web similar to the google scan but, with some advanced suggestions like at the side of the result like sometimes you know even after selecting the text on the image the google scan show's that there's not the match of searching on the web so, for this condition as an advancement there should be an assistant output window at the side of the web search window where the assistant either will learn the whole image texted data & provide the output like "It seems like you're searching for this...And, solutions for it are...for further info & research visit 1) example1.com,...." OK now go for it with a very simple U!!Please use these techstacks only (html,css,js,& python(pandas,djangoPyTorch TensorFlow Scikit-learn NumPy Keras Pandas Matplotlib SciPy Theano NLTK Seaborn OpenCV XGBoost spaCy LangChain PyBrain Tensorflow Related Project Plotly ELI5 Mlpack)... And, make the bestest shit you've ever made... And, please don't disappoint me for the output...OK... Take how much time you wanna take to generate & how much line's of code you wanna make, full freedom I just want the satisfactory output!! Also, provide the file structure for it But, be aware that there should not be more files's than frontend, backend, & functions !! & I'm going to ask you for each code of each folder one after another so be aware that you should provide a proper integration between the codes!!
